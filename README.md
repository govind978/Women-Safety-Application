# Women-Safety-Application

Their are often times when we find ourselves in dangerous situations. These situations can arise from different sources, whether someone is following us for a long time or it’s dark and we find someone coming towards us. In India, majoritarily these situations are faced by women.
	Our idea is to come up with an application that on single button press, can send notification alerts to your emergency contacts as well as nearby state police along with your location. Although the idea may seem simple at first, but the impact of correct implementation may cause a huge effect to someone’s life
  
 # Tech Stack Used
 Android Studio, Java, Xml, MySQL
 
 
 # Implementation
 
 Main screen of the app will be having 4 buttons/modes: 'ADD CONTACTS', 'EMERGENCY THEFT', 'EMERGENCY DANGER', 'EMERGENCY ACCIDENT'
 
 In the above said modes, the first three modes make a call to police while texting your coordinates to your emergency contacts. In 'EMERGENCY ACCIDENT' mode the call will be placed to the nearest hospital while location coordinates will be sent to your emergency contacts.
 
 
 # Nobility of Idea and Implementation
 The biggest advantage that our approach gives is sending of location coordinates to custom emergency contacts of the user. With a single touch of button our app will capture the accurate coordinates and send them over network to emergency contacts through sms services availed by user of whatsoever service operator.
 
 # Privacy And Security
 The app use no trackers of personal information in whatsoever way possible except for the contacts information. All the data regarding contact information is stored locally on the user's device. No information regarding user or his contacts is synced to cloud databases. 
 
 
 
 
 
 # Scope of Project for Future
 The project can be linked with google maps api and whatsapp api's to send live location over whatsapp.
 The app can have multi language support. Right now it has only hindi and english language.
 Instead of button press, that can be triggered accidentally, the user could set a simple/complex combination of volume up, down and lock button to trigger the emergency protocols.
